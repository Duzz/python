print "(1): Above each line, use the (#) to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.\n"

print "(2): Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python? Start python this way again and using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.\n"

print "(3): Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.\n"

print "(4): Notice the math seems 'wrong'? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use a 'floating point' number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or evern 3.0.\n"

print "(5): Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point."
